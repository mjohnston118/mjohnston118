Postdoctoral Researcher in Developmental Psychology. Research interests include the development of cognitive control, proactive control, and episodic future thinking. Also interested in affective psychology and the links between anticipatory emotions and decision-making. See [here] (https://osf.io/kp68q_v1/) for my latest pre-print exploring the developmental dynamics between statistical learning and cognitive control. 

Beyond research, I enjoy drinking coffee and attempting to play electric guitar and bass guitar. See the link here for my latest music release with Edinburgh-based band [FERNS](https://musicoftheferns.bandcamp.com/album/fronds-in-high-places).
